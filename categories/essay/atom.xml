<blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>I’ve been trying to let go. It’s a work in progress, and it probably always will be, but I’m trying.</p></p><p><p>I’m looking for focus, and freedom from noise. More than that, I’m looking for stability; a metaphorical place where I have a chance of doing my best work.</p></p><p><p>I’m distracted by my interests, but that’s fine. What’s not fine is that I’m also distracted by things I might think are interesting at the time, but are really just opportunities to procrastinate.</p></p><p><p></p></blockquote></p>

Difficult people, demanding people, and people who impose too high a cost against the benefit they provide - or even just people that you can’t reasonably help.</p></p><p><p></p></blockquote></p>
