    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>Those are some reasons why many people my age tend to use Instagram more than they do Facebook. Everything about the application makes it less commercialized and more focused on the content, meaning more teens are inclined to visit it.

This increases our interaction with the application, meaning we will use it more, etc.</p></p><p><p></p></blockquote></p>
