    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another fascinating essays by <a href="https://twitter.com/@mattgemmell">Matt Gemmell</a>: 
<blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>I’ve been trying to let go. It’s a work in progress, and it probably always will be, but I’m trying.</p></p><p><p>I’m looking for focus, and freedom from noise. More than that, I’m looking for stability; a metaphorical place where I have a chance of doing my best work.</p></p><p><p>I’m distracted by my interests, but that’s fine. What’s not fine is that I’m also distracted by things I might think are interesting at the time, but are really just opportunities to procrastinate.</p></p><p><p></p></blockquote></p>

<p>I find this gems this morning and I think it’s worth to read. My favorite part of this blog post is:</p>

<p><blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>It goes beyond that, though. I’m letting go of people, too. I think it’s OK to let people pass you by. Difficult people, demanding people, and people who impose too high a cost against the benefit they provide - or even just people that you can’t reasonably help.</p></p><p><p></p></blockquote></p>
