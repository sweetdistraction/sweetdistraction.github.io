<p>Forget about Valentine Days. On February 14, 1990 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1">NASA’s Voyager Spacecraft</a> capture a photo of our solar system. The photo includes Neptune, Uranus, Jupiter, Venus and Earth-which showed up as pale blue dot in the brown light that resembles a beam of sunlight. This year, the photo is turned 25 years old.</p>

<p>The photo was taken when Voyager 1 was 40 astronomical units from the sun which is equivalent to 6000 million kilometers. </p>

<p>Carl Sagan wrote in his “Pale Blue Dot” book: 
<blockquote><p>“That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. … There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.”</p></blockquote></p>

<p>This photo is kinda a reminder that with all of our passion, all of our love, lucks and sucks, all of our dreams and shits we still isn’t bigger than a dust or even a pixel.</p>

<p>It’s good to be reminded this way once in a while. </p>
