    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://twitter.com/viticci">Federico Viticci</a> wrote a story that everyone should read:</p>

<blockquote><p>Since being diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma (Stage IV) in late 2011, my life changed. Beyond the psychological and emotional consequences of how cancer affected me, my family, and my relationships, it is undeniable and abundantly clear that cancer took its toll on me from a physical perspective.
<br />
<br />Last year, I decided to regain control of my body, my life habits, and my health. I started tracking everything I could about my activities, my exercise routine, the food I ate, and the time I spent working with my iPad instead of walking, sleeping, or enjoying time with my family. Since then, I&#8217;ve made a decision to not let cancer and its consequences define me any longer.
<br />
<br />I want to be healthier, I want to eat better, and I want to take the second chance I was given and make the most of it. What started as an experiment has become a new daily commitment to improve my lifestyle and focus.
<br />
<br />And it wouldn&#8217;t be possible without my iPhone.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In a few months (I first started testing Workflow in August 2014), Workflow has become an essential component of how I get work done on iOS. The improvements and features launched today extend the app&#8217;s capabilities deeper into native iOS frameworks – whether you want to find photos, filter files and calendar events, or save selections from Safari, Workflow is becoming a command center for iOS that can do anything. It&#8217;s powerful, and there are still a few issues to fix, but it&#8217;s useful, and, even better, it&#8217;s fun.</p></blockquote>

<p>I’ve tweeted about Workflow several time and if you need a good place to start then look no further. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://sweetdistraction.github.io/images/palebluedot.jpg" /></p>

<p>Forget about Valentine Days. On February 14, 1990 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1">NASA’s Voyager Spacecraft</a> capture a photo of our solar system. The photo includes Neptune, Uranus, Jupiter, Venus and Earth-which showed up as pale blue dot in the brown light that resembles a beam of sunlight. This year, the photo is turned 25 years old.</p>

<p>The photo was taken when Voyager 1 was 40 astronomical units from the sun which is equivalent to 6000 million kilometers. </p>

<p>Carl Sagan wrote in his “Pale Blue Dot” book: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s here. That&#8217;s home. That&#8217;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. &#8230; There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This photo is kinda a reminder that with all of our passion, all of our love, lucks and sucks, all of our dreams and shits we still isn’t bigger than a dust or even a pixel.</p>

<p>It’s good to be reminded this way once in a while. </p>

<blockquote><p>There’s something comforting about large screens; I’m well aware of that, and I feel it too. The expanse of screen-space hints at creative possibilities. You probably wouldn’t want to do full-time graphics work or app development without a large and/or additional screen, either. You can, but those are specialised disciplines where you can make a strong argument for two-up or even larger displays.
<br />
<br /> For the vast bulk of stuff that most people will want to do on a computer, though, most of the time you don’t need a desktop monster. I don’t think you even need a 15” screen, which is essentially a portable desktop. You just have to use a small screen productively.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.joecieplinski.com/blog/2015/01/05/compromises-have-consequences/">Joe Cieplinski</a> write responses about Marco’s thought:</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost two years ago, I suggested that Apple would be better off slowing down and taking a year off to fix bugs and enhance already existing features, rather than continue the fevered pace of innovation that it had maintained for so many years. Clearly, Tim Cook ignored my advice. And how could he not? After Jobs’ death, the world consistently questioned Cook’s ability to keep the company in its role as the richest, most powerful, and innovative tech company in the universe. He had a lot to prove. There were expectations that needed to be met, and so he met them.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, meeting those expectations has had consequences.
<br />
<br />You can’t have it both ways. You can’t stay way ahead of the curve and not introduce some bugs along the way. This decline in software quality is a side-effect of the current strategy. It’s a compromise Apple has made in order to reassure the general public that the company isn’t “doomed” without Steve Jobs.</p></blockquote>

<p>And he put this before closing paragraph:</p>

<blockquote><p>The unfortunate reality is that “Here’s a new version that’s the same as the old version, except now everything works” is a tough sell.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/viticci">Federico Viticci</a> on <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/balance/">Macstories</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>What it comes down to, really, is balance. I believe that Apple used to be more disciplined at balancing its desire for new features and commitment to refinements.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sure, Apple has a lot of things in their to do list. As I wrote <a href="http://sweetdistractions.net/that-goddamn-truth/">last night</a>, many new features will also bring a new bugs and maybe impact on stability. Does current Apple’s software quality decline? Yes it does. Does it just work like ever before? Yes but I’m not sure I’ll answer it wholeheartedly. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment">Marco Arment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I suspect the rapid decline of Apple’s software is a sign that marketing is too high a priority at Apple today: having major new releases every year is clearly impossible for the engineering teams to keep up with while maintaining quality. Maybe it’s an engineering problem, but I suspect not — I doubt that any cohesive engineering team could keep up with these demands and maintain significantly higher quality.</p><p><br />The problem seems to be quite simple: they’re doing too much, with unrealistic deadlines.</p><p><br />We don’t need major OS releases every year. We don’t need each OS release to have a huge list of new features. We need our computers, phones, and tablets to work well first so we can enjoy new features released at a healthy, gradual, sustainable pace.</p></blockquote>

<p>That goddamn truth! I don’t deny that iOS and OS X are rapidly growing over these 2 years. Many features and improvements they put at their software but it also increase the bugs, crashes and inconsistency. So many things are broken and need to be fixed. At least they need to slow down the software upgrade cycle and start to fix everything they broke.</p>
