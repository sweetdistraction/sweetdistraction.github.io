    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I wrote about how to <a href="http://sweetdistractions.net/Chaining-Things-and-iOS-Reminders-with-IFTTT/">chaining Things and web automation service IFTTT</a>. This workaround comes because I have to use PC at work and since my choice app of GTD is Things then I need to sort this problem out. Even I can pick up my iPhone and write down the task directly to <a href="https://culturedcode.com">Things</a> inbox, it’s not a pleasant things to do. 
<!--more--></p>

<p>I have <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8">Drafts</a> installed on my iPhone and since it’s a place where text start on iOS, I mainly used it to save article for a blog post ideas. I also use Drafts for do brain dump and send to Things inbox later but what about if I want to quickly capture ideas that suddenly pop-up and I need to get out of it from my mind soon? This is where <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/do-note-by-ifttt/id905998379">Do Note</a> by IFTTT take a role.</p>

<p>With my impulsiveness, my mind is unpredictable. Sometimes an idea pop-up in the wrong place and time. To get this idea out of my mind as quickly as possible, I use Do Note. I only need a recipe that makes a task/idea in iOS reminders. Things have reminders integration so whenever I take a note using Do Note and send them to iOS reminders, Things will pick and save it to its inbox. One thing you should pay attention is you have to choose the same iOS reminder list between Do Notes and Things.</p>

<p>The only caveats using this method is sometimes the task/ idea that’s made using Do Note doesn’t appear automatically neither in iOS reminder or Things. I guess it needs to be synced first before the task/ ideas appear. </p>

<p>I know that Drafts could make multiple to-dos to Things inbox and even you can add notes but for an ideas/ tasks that need to get out soon, you can use Do Notes just like I do. </p>

<blockquote><p>A blog doesn’t have to be a diary. There doesn’t have to be an explicit or implied chronology, with the attendant ephemerality and fading relevance that date-focused organisation brings. If you want it, great - it’s there. But opt in.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another fascinating essays by <a href="https://twitter.com/@mattgemmell">Matt Gemmell</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve been trying to let go. It’s a work in progress, and it probably always will be, but I’m trying.
<br />
<br />I’m looking for focus, and freedom from noise. More than that, I’m looking for stability; a metaphorical place where I have a chance of doing my best work.
<br />
<br />I’m distracted by my interests, but that’s fine. What’s not fine is that I’m also distracted by things I might think are interesting at the time, but are really just opportunities to procrastinate.</p></blockquote>

<p>I find this gems this morning and I think it’s worth to read. My favorite part of this blog post is:</p>

<blockquote><p>It goes beyond that, though. I’m letting go of people, too. I think it’s OK to let people pass you by. Difficult people, demanding people, and people who impose too high a cost against the benefit they provide - or even just people that you can’t reasonably help.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Twitterrific’s glance gives you a fun, visual digest of the total number of favorites, retweets and new followers you’ve received over the past 24 hours.

<blockquote><p>The best thing about MindNode is that it is incredibly easy to use. The UI is simple and intuitive, even if you’re not an experienced mind mapper. In fact, you could probably start using MindNode without even fully understanding the concept of mind mapping because the user interface will actually teach you how to do it.</p></blockquote>

<p>I absolutely agree with that. A months ago when I prepared a presentation about HbA1C, I didn’t know where to start. I searched for every mind mapping apps and choosed MindNode. The app is easy to use and there’s no learning curve at all. You can instantly do mind mapping using MindNode. I think that’s a clear sign that’s MindNode is an awesome app. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know about you guys but I’ve never use any third party browser on iOS. Safari is my main browser but, today, Chrome gets an update that bring widget, gesture and 1Password support. The widget available in the Today View of Notification Center which bring two buttons. One for open a new tab and one for doing voice search within Chrome app.
<!--more--></p>

<p>There’s also a button which is can be used to open the link you’ve copied into clipboard. That’s handy features when you want to do a quick search over the link you find in the other apps.</p>

<p>The 1Password integration is the one I love which is brought a deeper integration with iOS 8. It allow 1Password to fill logins using action extension. It’s good to see that Google bring attention to its app with extensions support and widgets.</p>

<p>You can download Chrome for iOS version 42 on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chrome-web-browser-by-google/id535886823?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">App Store</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>GTD or <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com">Getting Things Done®</a> is a stress free productivity technique based on David Allen which is awesome and many of the nerds talk about it. It’s simply take 5 steps to GTD: capture, clarify, organize, reflect and engage. Sounds easy, huh?</p>

<p>I knew it last year. Since then I tried to get many references and tools to support GTD systems. I still failed. Sometimes I still fall into cracks, sometimes I let my lists outdated, and the next week I rebuild it.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve tried <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">Omnifocus</a>, plain text based <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper">Taskpaper</a>, Things for my task management system to implement GTD and the last one is my choice. <a href="http://culturedcode.com">Cultured Code</a> the developer behind Things make a great software even the development pace is too slow according to some people.</p>

<p>I love using Things because of its simplicity. The syncing is also fast and reliable. The ease of using Things is there’s no learning curve instead of GTD itself. I don’t said that Omnifocus isn’t a great tools but I get myself overwhelm everytime I open Omnifocus and try to use it. </p>

<p>One features that makes me envy as Things user from Omnifocus is MailDrop features which you can use to send a task to your inbox just by emailing it. Why I envy this features is the fact that I have to use PC at work and there’s such Things for Windows to easily put the task in. </p>

<p>Luckily there’s service called <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> which we can use to mimic Omnifocus’ Maildrop features. Things have Reminders integrations which can import all the task in the reminder to its inbox. Now all you have to do is just set up a email trigger in IFTTT that would add a body email as a task with preferred tags in subjects to iOS Reminders. I have Things list in my iOS Reminders that Things ready to import. So, all I need is to set up a recipe that will be triggered by an email with #thingstodo as tag in subjects and a task which I want to add in Things in body email. You can get the IFTTT recipe <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/278606-thingstodo-email-to-ios-reminders">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now wherever something pops out in my mind while I’m working at work, I just compose email with that tags and send them. At lunch, I will open Things and the list is ready to import. </p>

<p>Sometimes, the recipes don’t start automatically and I have to open IF apps but at least, I become worry less to forget what’s important during works.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Federico Viticci</a> thought about iOS 8 and bunch of its features last year on Macstories:</p>
<blockquote><p>What I realized in using extensions is how necessary last year&#8217;s redesign of iOS was. Imagine if Apple didn&#8217;t ship a new design with iOS 7: today, we&#8217;d have sheets of stitched leather or shiny metal on top of apps that look like agendas or little robots. The cohesiveness and subdued style that iOS 7 brought with its precise structure and hierarchy allows extensions to integrate nicely with apps, feeling like extra actions rather than eerily realistic objects.
<br />
<br />The impact of action and share extensions on my workflow has been massive even with only a few apps and bugs left in iOS 8. I use my iPad more because I spend less time switching between apps, copying text around, or moving files between different containers. I&#8217;m more efficient thanks to extensions because the quality of the software I use every day has increased considerably. I can&#8217;t imagine what we&#8217;ll start seeing today with action and share extensions on the App Store.</p></blockquote>

<p>When iOS 7 came out, I didn’t satisfy with the new UI. I wished there’s a way to downgrade back to iOS 6. The main reason was the unbearable lagging and blindly white all over iOS for that time. Then iOS 8 came out last year, I upgraded. Now when I look at iOS today, I would think many times to downgrade even when there’s a way to do. </p>

<p>Extensions, change how we used iOS. I could easily post to Tumblr, Path, Twitter. I could easily find a inspiring quote, make selection and save it on my Notes folder in Dropbox that also available on my nvAlt. 3rd party keyboard, let us manage multiple clipboard like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/clips-copy-paste-anywhere/id917638056?mt=8">Clips</a> does. Finding the right emoji, now become easier, there’s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emoji++-fast-emoji-keyboard/id919234935?mt=8">Emoji++</a>.</p>

<p>And if I look back to iOS 6 (yeah, my friends still use iOS 6.1.3 in her iPhone 4s), it look dull and outdated.</p>

You can do something easily on Mac but maybe not in Windows and vice versa. Overmore, I’ve to work in Windows machine with limited user previlege so I can’t install any software I want. </p>

<p>If you know what apps that I miss when working in Windows, I would gladly say it’s TextExpander. I feel I could do anything with with <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a> on my Mac but when it comes to work with my lovely Windows machine, I feel odd. Luckily I found a similar apps, <a href="www.phraseexpress.com">PhraseExpress</a>. 
<!--more--></p>

<p>I’m working with thousand files on the network storage at office. The pain is when I’ve to move from a folder to another folder and imagine when you’ve to dig into 4 nested folder to get the files, how many mouse clicks and scroll you need? So I want to make a snippets that expand into a directory address and simulating <code>Enter</code> key so I automatically jump to the destination folder. Luckily I found this <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/01/04/mass-creating-textexpander-snippets/">blog post</a> by Brett Terpstra. </p>

<p>I’ve been long reader of <a href="http://twitter.com/ttscoff">@ttscoff</a> blog. I use some of his projects, nvAlt, <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/bretts-popclip-extensions/">PopClip extensions</a>, <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/">SearchLink</a>and his crazy <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/keybindings/">keybindings</a>. So after reading his blog post, I fired up MS Excel and make the .csv files as suggested. The script ran very well and it took less than a 30 seconds to make almost 300 snippets on my CSV file, really a time saver.</p>

<p>I modified the script a bit to put the label for the snippets that would be created. On the .CSV file, put the label on the third row. </p>

<p>Here’s the modified version:</p>

	unless output_te =~ /\.textexpander$/
		puts &quot;Second argument must have a &#39;.textexpander&#39; extension.&quot;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://twitter.com/viticci">Federico Viticci</a> wrote a story that everyone should read:</p>

<blockquote><p>Since being diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma (Stage IV) in late 2011, my life changed. Beyond the psychological and emotional consequences of how cancer affected me, my family, and my relationships, it is undeniable and abundantly clear that cancer took its toll on me from a physical perspective.
<br />
<br />Last year, I decided to regain control of my body, my life habits, and my health. I started tracking everything I could about my activities, my exercise routine, the food I ate, and the time I spent working with my iPad instead of walking, sleeping, or enjoying time with my family. Since then, I&#8217;ve made a decision to not let cancer and its consequences define me any longer.
<br />
<br />I want to be healthier, I want to eat better, and I want to take the second chance I was given and make the most of it. What started as an experiment has become a new daily commitment to improve my lifestyle and focus.
<br />
<br />And it wouldn&#8217;t be possible without my iPhone.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Federico Viticci</a> on <a href="www.macstories.net">MacStories</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a few months (I first started testing Workflow in August 2014), Workflow has become an essential component of how I get work done on iOS. The improvements and features launched today extend the app&#8217;s capabilities deeper into native iOS frameworks – whether you want to find photos, filter files and calendar events, or save selections from Safari, Workflow is becoming a command center for iOS that can do anything. It&#8217;s powerful, and there are still a few issues to fix, but it&#8217;s useful, and, even better, it&#8217;s fun.</p></blockquote>

<p>I’ve tweeted about Workflow several time and if you need a good place to start then look no further. </p>

<blockquote><p>Apple Watch Edition is not a tech product, so don’t try to price it like one.</p></blockquote>

<p>I love the footnote of his post: </p>

<blockquote><p>At prices like these, an Apple Watch Edition is not an accessory for your iPhone — your iPhone is an accessory for your Apple Watch Edition.</p></blockquote>

Just write the code in Lua language and it can interact with OS X APIs such as: clipboard, mouse pointers,filesystem objects, audio, batteries, and more.</p>

<p>If your nerdy side is kickin’ out then why not to try this?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://sweetdistraction.github.io/images/palebluedot.jpg" /></p>

<p>Forget about Valentine Days. On February 14, 1990 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1">NASA’s Voyager Spacecraft</a> capture a photo of our solar system. The photo includes Neptune, Uranus, Jupiter, Venus and Earth-which showed up as pale blue dot in the brown light that resembles a beam of sunlight. This year, the photo is turned 25 years old.</p>

<p>The photo was taken when Voyager 1 was 40 astronomical units from the sun which is equivalent to 6000 million kilometers. </p>

<p>Carl Sagan wrote in his “Pale Blue Dot” book: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s here. That&#8217;s home. That&#8217;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. &#8230; There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This photo is kinda a reminder that with all of our passion, all of our love, lucks and sucks, all of our dreams and shits we still isn’t bigger than a dust or even a pixel.</p>

<p>It’s good to be reminded this way once in a while. </p>
